# Vector-Even-Integer-Search
This program performs a search operation between two distinct vectors, identifying even integers, and returns their corresponding coordinates. 
It efficiently processes the input vectors to extract relevant information, providing a clear output of the coordinates for easy reference.


This C++ code searches for even numbers in two sets of vectors (Data1 and Data2). 
It defines functions to display locations and search for even numbers. 
In the main function, it applies these functions to the vectors and prints the results.
